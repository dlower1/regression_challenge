# Housing Price Regression Challenge
### A (relatively) straightforward regression project predicting house prices in Ames, Iowa

This project is the result of a small Kaggle competition I took part in. The goal was to predict the prices of homes in Ames, Iowa. The tricky part of the dataset was that the train and test sets we were given are unbalanced; features in the test set are not in the train and vice versa. The jupyter notebook within this repo gives a general overview of, given a dataset, my process for EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling.
