# Housing Price Regression Challenge
### A (relatively) straightforward regression project predicting house prices in Ames, Iowa

This project is the result of a small Kaggle competition I took part in. The goal was to predict the prices of homes in Ames, Iowa. The tricky part of this dataset is that the train and test sets are unbalanced; features in the test set are not in the train and vice versa. The jupyter notebook within this repo gives a general overview of my process for **EDA**, **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **modeling**.
